description: |-
  Combination drug therapy is a widely used paradigm for managing numerous human
  malignancies. In cancer treatment, additive and/or synergistic drug combinations can convert
  weakly efficacious monotherapies into regimens that produce robust anti-tumor activity. This can
  be explained in part through pathway interdependencies that are critical for cancer cell
  proliferation and survival. However, identification of the various interdependencies is difficult
  due to the complex molecular circuitry that underlies tumor development and progression. Here,
  we present a high-throughput platform that allows for an unbiased identification of synergistic
  and efficacious drug combinations. In a screen of 22,737 experiments of 583 doublet
  combinations in 39 diverse cancer cell lines using a 4 by 4 dosing regimen, both well-known and
  novel synergistic and efficacious combinations were identified. Here, we present an example of
  one such novel combination, a Wee1 inhibitor (AZD1775) and an mTOR inhibitor
  (ridaforolimus), and demonstrate that the combination potently and synergistically inhibits
  cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. This approach has identified novel combinations that
  would be difficult to reliably predict based purely on our current understanding of cancer cell
  biology.
